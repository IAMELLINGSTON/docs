# Migrate from .NET Core 2.2 to 3.0

This article shows you the basic steps for migrating your .NET Core 2.2 app to 3.0. If you're looking to migrate your ASP.NET Core app to 3.0, see [Migrate from ASP.NET Core 2.2 to 3.0](/aspnet/core/migration/22-to-30).

For an overview of the new features in .NET Core 3.0, see [What's new in .NET Core 3.0](../whats-new/dotnet-core-3-0.md).

## Update the project file to use 3.0 versions

- Open the project file (the \*.csproj, \*.vbproj, or \*.fsproj file).

- Change the [target framework](../../standard/frameworks.md) value from `netcoreapp2.2` to `netcoreapp3.0`. The target framework is defined by the `<TargetFramework>` or `<TargetFrameworks>` element.

  For example, change `<TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.2</TargetFramework>` to `<TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework>`.
